The Messidor-2 dataset is a collection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) examinations, each consisting of two macula-centered eye fundus images (one per eye).

Part of the dataset (<i>Messidor-Original</i>) was kindly provided by the Messidor program partners (see http://messidor.crihan.fr). The remainder (Messidor-Extension) consists of never-before-published examinations from Brest University Hospital.

In the original Messidor dataset, some fundus images came in pairs, some others were single. <i>Messidor-Original</i> consists of all image pairs from the original Messidor dataset, that is 529 examinations (1058 images).

In order to populate <i>Messidor-Extension</i>, diabetic patients were recruited in the Ophthalmology department of Brest University Hospital (France) between October 16, 2009 and September 6, 2010. Eye fundi were imaged, without pharmacological dilation, using a Topcon TRC NW6 non-mydriatic fundus camera with a 45 degree field of view. Only macula-centered images were included in the dataset.  <i>Messidor-Extension</i> contains 345 examinations (690 images).

Overall, Messidor-2 contains 874 examinations (1748 images). The dataset comes with an excel spreadsheet containing image pairing. All images and the attached spreadsheet are stored in a Zip archive that can be dowloaded at this address: ???
